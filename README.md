# pcf

The Policy Control Function (PCF) supports unified policy framework to govern
network behaviour, provides policy rules to Control Plane function(s) to enforce
them and Accesses subscription information relevant for policy decisions in a
Unified Data Repository (UDR)

The reference 3GPP specification for PCF are as follows
- PCC framework Specification 23.503,
- Session Management Policy Control - Specification 29.512
- Policy and Charging Control signalling flows and QoS parameter mapping (Spec 29.513)


## PCF Block Diagram

## Supported Features
- PCF provides Access and Mobility Management related policies to the AMF
Subscription Data retrieval and AM Policy management
- PCF provides Session Management Policy Control Service to the SMF Subscription
Data retrieval and SM Policy management
- Policy Control Function (PCF) shall support interactions with the access and
mobility policy enforcement in the AMF, through service-based interfaces

## Upcoming Changes in PCF
- Process configuration received from Configuration Service and prepare PCC
Rules, Session Rules and Qos Flows
- Send PCC Rules, Session Rules to SMF when a SMF Creates Policy subscriber
- Send notification towards SMF PDU Session when PCF detects any changes in
Subscriberâ€™s Rule/Qos information.
- Dedicated QoS flows addition and removal through APIs
